The objective of this project is to create user-friendly and versatile Python frameworks for handling and analyzing chemical data.

Introducing [Chython](https://github.com/chython/chython) [ˈkʌɪθ(ə)n] - a library designed to process molecules and reactions using the Python way.

Also, meet [Chytorch](https://github.com/chython/chytorch) [kʌɪtɔːrtʃ] - a library tailored for modeling molecules and reactions using the PyTorch-like API.
